## 👋 Hi, I’m Spartak

I live in a small town in the south of Russia, in Elista, together with my beloved wife, our wonderful children, and our ginger cat. In my free time, I enjoy cycling outside the city, traveling with my family, and working on small engineering projects together with my children. Through these projects, they get hands-on experience with core engineering concepts — reading documentation, electronics, soldering, and programming.

My journey into computer science began in 1992, when I was in the first grade and first saw an IBM PC based on an Intel 80286 processor. That moment made a strong impression on me — I knew then that I wanted to become a programmer.

At the age of 13, I assembled my first computer built around a Celeron 333A processor. A year later, I wrote my first program in Turbo Pascal 7.0. At 17, I graduated from Elista Polytechnic College with a specialization in computer programming, computer hardware, and automated systems software, and soon after started my first job as a programmer.

That marked the beginning of my professional career in IT.

Alongside my practical work, I continue my academic development. I am currently pursuing a Master’s degree at ITMO University, at the Institute of Applied Computer Science, in the field of **Cloud Engineering**.

My Master’s thesis focuses on the security of containerized systems and software supply chains. The **contain-sentry** project is the practical part of this work and is used to research and formalize security checks for container builds.

## 💼 What I do now

I currently work at **MWS Cloud**, in a team focused on infrastructure and platform engineering.

I work on systems written in **Kotlin and Go** that automate the transformation of **bare metal servers** into fully managed nodes integrated into a cloud platform.

My work sits at the intersection of backend development, infrastructure, and platform engineering, and includes automating node lifecycle management, working closely with Linux systems, and building services that ensure the reliability and manageability of cloud infrastructure.

I enjoy working close to the system and understanding how things work under the hood — from bare metal provisioning and node bootstrapping to containers, networking, and CI/CD processes.
